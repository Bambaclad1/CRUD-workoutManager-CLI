# Just a CRUD Workout Manager
CRUD DotNet application allowing the user to perform CRUD operations with a application. This project is split in two phases:

- [ ] Phase 1: Create a CRUD application as a console application in C#
- [ ] Phase 2: Intregrate Avalonia UI Framework for a graphical application

So what does it do?
As a user, you can perform the following actions:
* Create a excercise through a guided step-for-step onboarding
* Retrieve excercises created saved in a .json format
* Create a workout, which can contain multiple excercises
* Retrieve a workout, saved in a .json as well
* Update excercises/workouts
* Remove excercises/workouts


Sounds complicated huh? ~~That's why im going through development hell~~ That is why this looks like a amazing challenge for me!

~~We love Microsoft docs recommending the user to just completely use AI!~~~

all jokes aside, this is a really nice challenge, and I'm glad that I got the green light to work on this from my school.

## Tech Stack
Do people these days actually share their entire stack developing programs? I think it's nice to have in a documentation, just to let others know how I coded this program.

**AI Usage Disclaimer**: *AI was mostly used for help with complex parts such as serializing JSON, aside from that, youtube videos,
and Microsoft docs/GeeksForGeeks/W3Schools was used. Oh btw, ChatGPT created this cool bannner at the start of the page :)*
